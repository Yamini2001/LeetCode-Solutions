## Maximum Subarray

The Maximum Subarray problem aims to find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum within an array of numbers.

### Implementation

- **File:** `maximum_subarray.java`
- **Description:** Contains an implementation of Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum in a given array.

## Merge Intervals

The Merge Intervals problem involves merging overlapping intervals or ranges.

### Implementation

- **File:** `merge_intervals.java`
- **Description:** Provides a function to merge overlapping intervals in a list of intervals.

## Regular Expression Matching

Regular Expression Matching involves determining whether a given string matches a given pattern.

## Adjacent Increasing SubArrays Detection

 Two adjacent subarrays of length k such that both subarrays are strictly increasing. 

 ## 3Sum Closest

 Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.

 ## Smallest Missing Non-Negative Integer After Operations
 The MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest missing non-negative integer in it.

 ## Maximise the number of partitions After Operations
 Return an integer denoting the maximum number of resulting partitions after the operations by optimally choosing at most one index to change.

 ## Maximum Number of Distinct Elements After Operations
Return the maximum possible number of distinct elements in nums after performing the operations.

## Lexicographically Smallest String After Applying Operations
Return the lexicographically smallest string you can obtain by applying the above operations any number of times on s.

## Value Of Variable After Operations
Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.

## Maximum Frequency of elements After Performing Operations
Return the maximum possible frequency of any element in nums after performing the operations.

## Longest Common Prefix
 A function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

 ## Check If Digits Are Equal in a String After Operations
 Perform the following operation repeatedly until the string has exactly two digits.

 ## Next Greater Numerically Balanced Number
 Given an integer n, return the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than n.

 ## Calculate Money in LeetCode Bank
 Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day.

 ## Simple Bank System
 A program for a popular bank that will automate all its incoming transactions (transfer, deposit, and withdrawal). The bank has n accounts numbered from 1 to n. The initial balance of each account is stored in a 0-indexed integer array balance, with the (i + 1)th account having an initial balance of balance[i].

### Implementation

- **File:** `regular_expression_matching.java`
- **Description:** Includes a recursive implementation of regular expression matching using backtracking.

## Usage

Each Java file contains a function or class implementing the respective algorithm. You can import these files and use the functions/classes as needed in your projects.
