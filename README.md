## Maximum Subarray

The Maximum Subarray problem aims to find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum within an array of numbers.

### Implementation

- **File:** `maximum_subarray.java`
- **Description:** Contains an implementation of Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum in a given array.

## Merge Intervals

The Merge Intervals problem involves merging overlapping intervals or ranges.

### Implementation

- **File:** `merge_intervals.java`
- **Description:** Provides a function to merge overlapping intervals in a list of intervals.

## Regular Expression Matching

Regular Expression Matching involves determining whether a given string matches a given pattern.

## Adjacent Increasing SubArrays Detection

 Two adjacent subarrays of length k such that both subarrays are strictly increasing. 

 ## 3Sum Closest

 Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.

 ## Smallest Missing Non-Negative Integer After Operations
 The MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest missing non-negative integer in it.

 ## Maximise the number of partitions After Operations
 Return an integer denoting the maximum number of resulting partitions after the operations by optimally choosing at most one index to change.

 ## Maximum Number of Distinct Elements After Operations
Return the maximum possible number of distinct elements in nums after performing the operations.

## Lexicographically Smallest String After Applying Operations
Return the lexicographically smallest string you can obtain by applying the above operations any number of times on s.

## Value Of Variable After Operations
Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.

## Maximum Frequency of elements After Performing Operations
Return the maximum possible frequency of any element in nums after performing the operations.

## Longest Common Prefix
 A function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

 ## Check If Digits Are Equal in a String After Operations
 Perform the following operation repeatedly until the string has exactly two digits.

 ## Next Greater Numerically Balanced Number
 Given an integer n, return the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than n.

 ## Calculate Money in LeetCode Bank
 Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day.

 ## Simple Bank System
 A program for a popular bank that will automate all its incoming transactions (transfer, deposit, and withdrawal). The bank has n accounts numbered from 1 to n. The initial balance of each account is stored in a 0-indexed integer array balance, with the (i + 1)th account having an initial balance of balance[i].

 ## Number of Laser Beams in a Bank
 Given a 0-indexed binary string array bank representing the floor plan of the bank, which is an m x n 2D matrix. bank[i] represents the ith row, consisting of '0's and '1's. '0' means the cell is empty, while'1' means the cell has a security device.

 ## Make Element Array to Zero
 Return the number of possible valid selections.

 ## Smallest Number With All Bits
 Return the smallest number x greater than or equal to n, such that the binary representation of x contains only set bits.

 ## Minimum number of Increments on Subarray to form a target Array
 Return the minimum number of operations to form a target array from the initial.

 ## Two Sneaky Numbers of DigitVille
 Return an array of size two containing the two numbers (in any order), so peace can return to Digitville.

 Return the head of the modified linked list after removing all nodes from the linked list that have a value that exists in nums.

 ## Count Unguarded cell in the grid
 Return the number of unoccupied cells that are not guarded.

 ## Minimum Time to make a colourful rope
 Return the minimum time Bob needs to make the rope colourful.

 ## Find X-Sum for all K-Long subArrays
 Return an integer array answer of length n - k + 1 where answer[i] is the x-sum of the subarray nums[i..i + k - 1].

 ## 4Sum
  return an array of all the unique quadruplets [nums[a], nums[b], nums[c], nums[d]]

  Return an array of integers representing the results of each query of type [1, x] in the order they appear.

  ## Maximise And Minimise Powered City
  Given the two integers r and k, return the maximum possible minimum power of a city, if the additional power stations are built optimally.

  ## Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero 
  Return the minimum number of operations to transform n into 0.

  ## Count Operations To Obtain Zero
  Return the number of operations required to make either num1 = 0 or num2 = 0.

  ## Minimum Operations to Convert All Elements to Zero
  Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array 0.

  ## Ones And Zeroes
  Return the size of the largest subset of strs such that there are at most m 0's and n 1's in the subset.

  ## Minimum Number of Operations to Make All Array Elements Equal to 1 
  Return the minimum number of operations to make all elements of nums equal to 1. If it is impossible, return -1.

  ## Maximum Number of Operations to Move Ones to the End
  Return the maximum number of operations that you can perform.

  ## Increment SubMatrices by One
  Return the matrix mat after performing every query.

  ## Count the Number of Substrings With Dominant Ones
  A string has dominant ones if the number of ones in the string is greater than or equal to the square of the number of zeros in the string.

  ## Number of Substrings With Only 1s 
  Given a binary string s, return the number of substrings with all characters 1's. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

  ## Check If All 1s Are at Least Length K Places Away 
  Given an binary array nums and an integer k, return true if all 1's are at least k places away from each other, otherwise return false.


### Implementation

- **File:** `regular_expression_matching.java`
- **Description:** Includes a recursive implementation of regular expression matching using backtracking.
