# Algorithms

This repository contains Java implementations of three classic algorithms:

- Maximum Subarray
- Merge Intervals
- Regular Expression Matching
  

## Maximum Subarray

The Maximum Subarray problem aims to find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum within an array of numbers.

### Implementation

- **File:** `maximum_subarray.java`
- **Description:** Contains an implementation of Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum in a given array.

## Merge Intervals

The Merge Intervals problem involves merging overlapping intervals or ranges.

### Implementation

- **File:** `merge_intervals.java`
- **Description:** Provides a function to merge overlapping intervals in a list of intervals.

## Regular Expression Matching

Regular Expression Matching involves determining whether a given string matches a given pattern.

## Adjacent Increasing SubArrays Detection

 Two adjacent subarrays of length k such that both subarrays are strictly increasing. 

 ## 3Sum Closest

 Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.

### Implementation

- **File:** `regular_expression_matching.java`
- **Description:** Includes a recursive implementation of regular expression matching using backtracking.

## Usage

Each Java file contains a function or class implementing the respective algorithm. You can import these files and use the functions/classes as needed in your projects.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or additional algorithms you'd like to add, feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request.
